Aatrox,"What foolish plan bore a woman such as you, Camille? You were a folly, crafted by an idiot.",TRUE,,,
Aatrox,What is property? Why did this dead hamster want me off of it?,TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"Where I was excellence, I am deformed… Recast poorly with these crude materials. But this abomination of flesh well serves my murderous intent.",TRUE,,,

Aatrox,You cannot destroy me!,TRUE,,,
Aatrox,You die… a fool.,TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"You disgust me, Morgana. Die in the filth of your bound flesh!",TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"You fought to live, Sion, yet it is I who am still alive. This at least amuses.",TRUE,,,
Aatrox,You think you can kill me?,TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"You would bind yourself to this realm. Morgana? Fine, let me show you the ground!",TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"You would challenge me in a machine? You are a strange spirit, Rumble.",TRUE,,,
Aatrox,You would end worlds? As a bow?!,TRUE,,,
Aatrox,"You would fight me?! Come, let me show you hell!",TRUE,,,

Akali,Getting stronger is the only option.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Gonna carve my own path.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Gotta get you a new statue, Lux.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Gotta stay alive… for Kai'Sa.,TRUE,,,

Akali,"Hit hard, hit fast!",TRUE,,,
Akali,How about I just end this.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"How about I take this life, Karma?",TRUE,,,
Akali,I am my own master. Just the way I like it.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I am so sick of shadows.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"I can count on you, right, Umi?",TRUE,,,
Akali,I can do better!,TRUE,,,
Akali,I can do this all day.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"I can make this fast, or really fast. Choice is yours.",TRUE,,,
Akali,I can't lose myself now!,TRUE,,,
Akali,I couldn't stop it…,TRUE,,,
Akali,I don't believe in the First Light.  I believe in us.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"I don't need babysitting, Nilah!",TRUE,,,
Akali,"I got a pack full of trouble, and nothing but time.",TRUE,,,
Akali,I just want my friend back.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I love what I do. My enemies won't.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I make problems… disappear.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"I only see you for missions now, Kai'Sa.  What happened to 'best friends forever'?",TRUE,,,
Akali,I sometimes wonder if taking the Oath was a mistake.  But I won't let my team fight alone.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I was just warming up.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I was trained to kill since I could walk.,TRUE,,,
Akali,I won't back down!,TRUE,,,

Akali,Is that Lux?  So you came down from your pedestal after all.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Is this a fallen Star Guardian, too?",TRUE,,,
Akali,"It's not a double life, it's two lives half-lived.",TRUE,,,
Akali,It's not about the killing. It's about who's doing the dying.,TRUE,,,
Akali,It's not the killing I'm about — it's the cause.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"It's okay, Sona, take a beat.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Jinx… Sketchy tats and certifiable. It's just sad.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Just give me a minute, okay?",TRUE,,,
Akali,Just try us!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Kai'Sa and I swore to save the world together, but… first we have to save ourselves.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Kai'Sa, stop trying to be Lux!  Do you wanna end up a statue, too?",TRUE,,,
Akali,Kai'Sa's more worried about being a Guardian than being a friend. *scoffs* She's changed.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Kama, or kunai… Depends how I'm feelin'.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Katarina! Today you will bleed for Ionia!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Kayn. Why are the hot ones always crazy…?,TRUE,,,

Akali,Let's go.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Let's have some fun.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Let's make this quick.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Like you had a chance.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Look, I don't wanna kill you… but I will.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Looks like 'little miss Ahri' isn't so perfect after all.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Magic's fine — steel's better.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"March to your own tempo, Sona, not the First Star's.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Mark acquired, and eliminated.",TRUE,,,

Akali,My friends are my power.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Nice work!  Who's next?,TRUE,,,
Akali,No falling stars today.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"No falling stars today.  Not you, and not me.",TRUE,,,
Akali,No more masters.,TRUE,,,
Akali,No more meditation or masters!,TRUE,,,
Akali,No more rules.,TRUE,,,
Akali,No one tells me what to do. Not anymore.,TRUE,,,
Akali,No one told me how hard it would be to balance world-saving and homework.,TRUE,,,

Akali,"Now you see me, now you don't.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Now you're really playing with fire, little girl.",TRUE,,,

Akali,"Oh, look. Someone's got a death wish.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Ohoho, Zed… This, I will enjoy.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Okay, that one was messy.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Okay, this, I got.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Okay…,TRUE,,,
Akali,"One down, a bajillion star monsters to go.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Only good Noxian… is a dead one.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Ooh, I could really use some ramen…",TRUE,,,
Akali,Our wills do not align.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Perfect execution.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Playtime's over.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Put you out of your misery! …I-I think, it's kinda hard to tell…",TRUE,,,
Akali,Quick and deadly!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Quickness is strength.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Ramen after this?,TRUE,,,
Akali,Restraint's not… really my thing.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Rewind and try again?,TRUE,,,
Akali,Rise to the light!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Sacrificing yourself isn't noble.  It just leaves the ones you love picking up the pieces.,TRUE,,,
Akali,School won't teach you how to fight.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Secrets kept die with you, Zed!",TRUE,,,
Akali,See ya!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Shadow strike!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Shadows do not equal evil!  Geez…,TRUE,,,
Akali,Shadows don't scare me.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Shine in darkness!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Shooting stars!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Should've been… stronger…,TRUE,,,
Akali,Should've run.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Should've stayed hidden.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Skill and steel will get the job done.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Smoked 'em.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"So many enemies, so many knives.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"So, no one else questions the First Star, huh?",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Sorry, Fortune, but I won't go easy on ya.  We're both Guardians now.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Star Guardians burn bright then burn out.  Doesn't anyone care?,TRUE,,,
Akali,Star Guardians have rules?  Ugh.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Star shadow!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Starlight or darkness… either way, now I'm ready.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Stars, guarded.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Stay aware of your surroundings.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Stay outta my way!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Steel beats rock, Taliyah.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Still feeling confident?,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Still haven't figured yourself out yet, Taliyah?  It's okay, you will.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Still time for you to do the smart thing: go home.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Take one life at a time. Fast. Clean.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Taking the Oath shouldn't be a death sentence.,TRUE,,,
Akali,That is just another reason for you to die.,TRUE,,,
Akali,That's right — payback hits hard.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"That's the monster that's been following me.  Euugh, is it looking?  Oh, please say no.",TRUE,,,
Akali,The darkness won't take me.,TRUE,,,
Akali,The Fist of Shadow was my mom — I do things differently.,TRUE,,,
Akali,The Kinkou couldn't control me. I do what they wouldn't.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"The mission doesn't matter.  My city, these people, they do.",TRUE,,,
Akali,The old ways just don't work.,TRUE,,,
Akali,The only one who can psych me out is me.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"The only rule that matters, is that your enemies don't walk away.",TRUE,,,
Akali,The other Guardians shine bright.  I work best in shadow.,TRUE,,,
Akali,The rules hold you back! Leave 'em for someone who needs 'em.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"The will comes from within, not from the blade.",TRUE,,,
Akali,The words on their tombstones will be my new mantras.,TRUE,,,
Akali,There are over three hundred pressure points on the human body.  No one can protect 'em all.,TRUE,,,
Akali,These break… I won't.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"They can't stop me. I mean, they can try.",TRUE,,,
Akali,They had it coming.,TRUE,,,
Akali,They'll never notice I'm gone until it's too late.,TRUE,,,
Akali,This must be done.,TRUE,,,
Akali,This won't take long.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"This, is necessary.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Time for you to learn.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Time to do what's gotta be done.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Time to snuff out the light, Lux!",TRUE,,,
Akali,To save them!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Too fast for shadows.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Too fast! Too good!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Try to keep up!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Twilight falls.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Ugh, Jhin. What a drama queen.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Ugh, that was gross.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Uh… ha ha?,TRUE,,,
Akali,Umi on target!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Umi, you get me.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Urgh!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Wars are messy. My kills are clean.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Watch your back.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"We swore to protect the world, but… we're part of it, too.",TRUE,,,
Akali,We were heroes before we took the Oath.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Well you aren't much of a challenge.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"We're gonna do this my way: quick, and deadly.",TRUE,,,
Akali,We're just sparkly little soldiers in a never-ending war.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"We're not done yet, Umi.",TRUE,,,
Akali,What a shame. I liked that little guy!,TRUE,,,
Akali,What is that thing?!  Stop following me!,TRUE,,,
Akali,What kind of messed-up star makes you fight your best friend?!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"What?  No snacks?  Alright, what else you got?",TRUE,,,
Akali,"What's a little more rubble, right?",TRUE,,,
Akali,"When Star Guardians lose themselves to doubt, to despair, they fall.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Where'd they go?,TRUE,,,
Akali,Whoa!  Watch out!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Who's next?,TRUE,,,
Akali,"With my friends, I'll always rise from the shadows!",TRUE,,,
Akali,"With or without the mask, a Guardian is a Guardian, Quinn.",TRUE,,,
Akali,Won't beat me.,TRUE,,,
Akali,Yeah!,TRUE,,,
Akali,"Yi, another master no one needs.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You both die, and both lose.",TRUE,,,
Akali,You came a long way to die.,TRUE,,,
Akali,You can never have too many kunai.,TRUE,,,
Akali,You don't get back what I take.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You know what it means to fall, Xayah… better than most.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You know, we've never met, but you seem really annoying.",TRUE,,,
Akali,You look so peaceful.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You may be their hero, Ahri, but you're not mine.",TRUE,,,
Akali,You may wanna rethink this little encounter.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You protect your friends, Fortune.  Well, so do I.",TRUE,,,
Akali,You prune the tree. I'm gonna pull some weeds.,TRUE,,,
Akali,You really want those to be your last words?,TRUE,,,
Akali,You think you're gonna walk away?,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You threaten my friends, you die.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You want to save him, Xayah?  Then you've gotta be better than this.",TRUE,,,
Akali,You will not stop me!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Your colors won't fly here!,TRUE,,,
Akali,Your window to run away… is closing.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You're dead, I'm alive. See? Balance!",TRUE,,,
Akali,You're done.,TRUE,,,
Akali,"You're gonna need those bandages, little guy.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You're scared, good to know.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You're stronger than you think, Taliyah.  Now it's time to prove it.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"You're the big shot hero of the stars?  Do better, Nilah.",TRUE,,,
Akali,"Youth and skill, every time.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,A friend has gone silent. Let's wake them up shall we?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,A scoundrel left alone will always be a scoundrel.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,A villain will show you much when they don't know you are watching.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Absolve… me.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Akshan, away!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,All in the wrist.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Always hard taking a life. But I get over it.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Any last words?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Can't talk. Sentinel business. Super important.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Coming through!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Confess!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Consider yourself… absolved.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Curse this nagging conscience of mine.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Dear friends, please stop dying. -Love, Akshan.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Death? I laugh at death! Ha! Listen to me laugh!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Defend yourself!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"'Don't use the absolver', they said. 'No one must wield such a weapon'. Eh, I disagree.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Eyes on the cape.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Fixing the world, one scoundrel at a time!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Go. And die no more.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Gotcha!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Greetings, fellow sentinel! How strange that we are not friends today. Oh, well.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha ha! The thrill of going where you're not supposed to.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha ha! Their eyes cannot find me.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha! Boomerang!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha! I have sneaked upon you!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Ha! I have you now.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Hahaha! They never expect the grappling hook!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Have a good rest?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Have you no shame?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,He who takes a life bears its mark on his soul.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Heads up!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Here comes the 'uppance!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Here we go. Get in. Avenge fallen ally. Get out.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Hey! Grappling hook buddies! No? Okay, suit yourself.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Hey! I snuck in.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,How does this boomerang return? Someday I'm going to learn its secrets.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,How well I know the silence of a lonely life.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Huh, nice place. Lotta things to swing from.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,I can feel them shaking in their armor. I love this part.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I come and go at unpredictable times. That is Akshan's thing!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I do not break rules. I bend them. Ever so slightly.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I don't envy you.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"I don't know how you live with yourself, but you won't have to for long.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,I hate shooting them in the back. I don't get to see their surprise.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"I hear the dead crying out for vengeance. I am coming, friend!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,I know what you're feeling. It's regret.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I know you! You're that kid who stole the gauntlet.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I live by my own code. Don't be an ass.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I once knew someone who followed the rules. She's dead.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"I taunt with my grappling hook. See how it taunts you? Taunt, taunt, taunt…",TRUE,,,
Akshan,I'm afraid you must pay.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"I'm back! Take note, evil!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,I'm going to remember this.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Is it wrong to kill killers? Eh, I'll ponder that later.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,It was nothing. Really.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,It's as fun as it looks.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,It's important to stride into the wind so the cape flutters dramatically behind.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,It's not too late to turn around you know.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I've got quite a few tricks up my cape.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,I've got something for you. It's… comeuppance.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Just desserts coming right up.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Killing this person won't bring my friend back. Actually, it will! Let's go do that.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Knock, knock. Vengeance calling.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Let's try not to do that again, hm?",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Like the mysterious boomerang, I always return.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Listen to them. 'Oh no, is Akshan coming to kill me?' Hahahahaha. I am!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Look at it go!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Miss me?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Mmm, yes. Villainy is near.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"No shame in starting over! So I tell myself, anyway.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Not everything happens for a reason. Some things need to be sorted out.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Now for my grand escape. Grappling hook!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Now think about what you did.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Oh come now.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Oh, so exciting!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Oh, the anticipation!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Oh… I see…,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Ohohoho, I love sneaking.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Okay, villains. Time to soil yourselves.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Once they see me, it is too late for forgiveness.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Only one way out of this mess. Skyward!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"People without grappling hooks, what are they thinking?",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Reclaimed by the light! Yadda-yadda-yadda…,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Right, then. Up we go!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Say your goodbyes.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Scoundrel!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Shadya would approve of this. I think. You never could tell with her.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Shadya would not approve of this act of vengeance but… she wouldn't approve of a lot of things.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Shadya's frowning at me now. I should've paid more attention to her lessons.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Silly Viego, we can't bring back those we've lost. I mean, I can but… not you.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,So… back at square one again. Let us proceed to a better square.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,So… how's it going?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,So… this is what it's like to have friends.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Some people deserve a low blow.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Some people just don't want to pay with their lives.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Some people say I hold a grudge too long but… those people are dead.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Someone gave me comeuppance? Ha! Who do they think they are?,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Sometimes fate just needs a little nudge.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Sometimes, I even sneak up on myself!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Sorry, can't let you live. You understand.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Stealth tiiime!"" Akshan lowers the tone of his voice ""I mean… Stealth time…",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Take your comeuppance.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Talk is worthless. We are what we do.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,That hurts…,TRUE,,,
Akshan,That was quite satisfying.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,That was very clever. I hope it was worth your life.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,That's right. It is I.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,The bad part about having friends? Always having to avenge them.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,The world won't save itself. You know.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,There is no such thing as fate. But there is such a thing as Akshan.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,There you are. Welcome back.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"There, now everyone's happy. Except you.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,They take one of mine. I take one of theirs.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Things to do. Scores to settle.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"This cape is not up to Sentinel Code. But, neither is the grappling hook, nor the boomerang.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,This is when I shoot you.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,To the shadows… where the scoundrels hide.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Too late to atone.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Tsk, tsk.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Up, up and… maybe not.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Vengeance is not a healthy impulse. Here's to bad health!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Vengeance with a smile.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Watch it fly!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Watch your head!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"We are not helpless. We are the ones who shape our destinies. Now, let's go shoot these villains in the face.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,Well if it isn't sentinel serious. Look at all the rules I'm breaking.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Well. This is embarrassing.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Well. You look very guilty of something.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,What else can I add to this gun? Maybe a shovel. No-a ladder!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Who am I to decide who lives and dies? Huh. Just a guy.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Whoosh!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,Yeah. I'd say we're even.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Yes, yes. The guy who revives people died… I'm really going to hear about this one…",TRUE,,,
Akshan,"Yes, yes. You can thank me later.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,You are reclaimed. Go! Live!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,You don't deserve life.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,You earned this.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,You know why I'm here.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"You know you had that coming, right?",TRUE,,,
Akshan,You try to rest and some lowlife kills one of your pals. Such is life.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"You work with Viego, yes? Scoundrel by association!",TRUE,,,
Akshan,You're an easy one to find.,TRUE,,,
Akshan,You're from Shurima? And have a boomerang? We should hang out!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,You're going to love this!,TRUE,,,
Akshan,"You're in deep, friend.",TRUE,,,
Akshan,You've been naughty.,TRUE,,,
Alistar,GG!,TRUE,,,
Alistar,I know the way.,TRUE,,,

Jhin,"Yes, the gun is ironic.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You are all dancing in the palm of my hand.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You are mediocrity. My genius will supplant you.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You are not separate from all that is.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You belong in the shadows. No audience could love you.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You can take my soul… if you'll shut up.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You can't fight providence Xayah, you can only… embrace it.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You corruptants are all pale imitations of a true masterpiece: the absence of everything.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You fear erasure, but that's why I chose you.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You have gone, beauty is all that remains.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You have too many lines.,TRUE,,,

Jhin,You lack imagination.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You must embrace infinity.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You never understood the value of the work Thresh, and therein lies the real tragedy.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You only understand harmony. Discord is required for contrast.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You opened that… gate? Excellent. I could use a change of scenery you know.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You see yourself as some poetic genius, Thresh.  I know you for the hack you are!",TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You shoot to kill, you better hit the heart.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You should learn the power of silence.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You shout and throw machetes? How quaint.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You think you can stop my performance?,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"You wanted to kill me back then, didn't you? You will learn - art cannot be killed.",TRUE,,,
Jhin,You were wrong to kill your master. I needed him for this performance.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You will be beautiful.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You will be poetry.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You will dance!,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You will learn what beauty truly is.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You will perform.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,You… inspire me.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your father was a merciful man. Only his failure will be remembered.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your father's death denied me a performance. You will be his stand-in.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your final scene begins.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your finale will be a duet.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your life had no value before me.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your molecules sing to me.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your music lacks the cruelty of a masterpiece.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your pedestrian dreams of greatness are ended gentlemen.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your people mistake loudness for import.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,Your story is revenge with guns and ghosts. How droll.,TRUE,,,
Jhin,"Your war was an impressive production, but it lacked soul.",TRUE,,,

Jinx,They say parting is such sweet sorrow… they're idiots.,TRUE,,,
Jinx,They… got me… ,TRUE,,,
Jinx,"This almost breaks my heart, Lux.",TRUE,,,
Jinx,This is not my idea of magical.,TRUE,,,
Jinx,This is the best part of being a Star Guardian!,TRUE,,,

Kai'Sa,Imagine a place where it's always night and you're holding faith for a dawn that never comes. I don't have to imagine. I've been there.,TRUE,,,

Kai'Sa,I've seen things you people wouldn't believe; attack ships on fire on the shoulders of Or-- …Are those peaches?,TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,I've trained for this!,TRUE,,,

Kai'Sa,"Look, honeyfruit! Your favorite.",TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,Looking for me?,TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,"Losing a friend… I'm sorry, Ekko. I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,Love… fear… whatever it's called—it's survival that motivates everyone.,TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,"Lulu, your starlight is special. Let it shine!",TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,"Lux, I saw you vanquished the Twilight Star! Are you testing me?",TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,Marked by the Void.,TRUE,,,

Kai'Sa,"My carbon fiber exoskeleton is invulnerable to micro-meteorites, re-entry, and the vacuum of space."" Kai'Sa starts breathing heavily. ""It has but one flaw: it can be a tad itchy…",TRUE,,,

Kai'Sa,"Ohh, how I missed these!",TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,On target!,TRUE,,,
Kai'Sa,One mistake is all it takes.,TRUE,,,

Kayn,I don't think so.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I don't trust how easily you brought me back to life.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I feast upon the bones of unhallowed centuries. Nothing will escape me.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I find your will to live amusing..,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I guess that is better than walking.,TRUE,,,

Kayn,I was being literal.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I was born into a nation of despair and I alone am the remedy.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I was forged by the uncaring providence of war.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"I was forged to destroy, and you are in my way.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,I wield the whisper of darkness.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I will be emperor. I just need time and Ora.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I will carve myself upon you.,TRUE,,,

Kayn,"I'll paint the dying stars with your entrails, and love every second of it.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm always close.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm coming for you!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm curious to see if they stop you.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"I'm everything you wanted and more, Jinx!",TRUE,,,

Kayn,I'm impressed!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm just getting started.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm not acting creepy. I'm just really excited to be here!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm not sure I believe Ora is sentient.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm outta here!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm perfectly sane. Rhaast hasn't had any undue effect on… do you hear singing?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm sure that's just a rumour.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm sure you do.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"I'm the one with power now, Rhaast! You hear me!?",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"I'm the scythe, idiot! I only help out!",TRUE,,,
Kayn,I'm very excited.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"In death, Rhaast now serves me.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,In the future I see a great empire!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"In war it's referred to as, 'showing initiative'.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Inevitable.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Interesting…,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Ionians… Are they all as confident as you?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Is it too late to mention I'm a corruptant, forged by the Dark Star? Sorry, Kayn.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Is that truly all you desire?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Is there anyone left who can keep up with me?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Is there no one left to kill? You're welcome…,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Isn't this better than dying alone on some backwater? You can answer later.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"It did not have to end this way, Zed.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"It doesn't matter what you are, Rhaast. I'm going to win, and you're going to die.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,It draws close. A vast and broken god.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"It is the order that will break you, Rhaast.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,It makes for a better story.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"It should not have come to this, Zed…",TRUE,,,
Kayn,It turns out the scythe was evil and wants to annihilate all reality. Who could've guessed?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It will for me.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's all mine.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's all Rhaast now!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's all Rhaast now! Hehehehaha!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's like they were never there!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's my throne. Mine!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's not erased! Just broken.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's not the grandest stage for my empire. But it will be.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"It's nothing, Kayn. Nothing at all.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's so cute when they hide behind things!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's too late for this universe! Rhaast will always return.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,It's what's inside that counts!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I've been trapped on a backwater planet for untold millenia. Indulge me.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I've killed better.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I've never known a god who couldn't be beaten.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,I've trained all my life to serve the empire. Now it will serve me!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Jinx! Let's see who can do the most damage.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Just another worm.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Just kill everyone! It's much more efficient.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Just like me!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Just like that, and the world will be yours to destroy.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Just the one then, hmm?",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Kayn failed, as will you, Zed!",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Kayn is gone. What is left is ruination!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Kayn wasted this flesh. Rhaast will not.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Kayn weeps in the abyss between oblivions… Idiot.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Kayn's Ora will fuel my slaughter! Ahahaha, oh yes.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Keep cutting.,TRUE,,,

Kayn,Let's make this quick.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Let's open you up.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Let's see that meat on the outside!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Let's swat this insect!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Lies soothe the mind, don't they?",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Light offers no sanctuary.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Live by the shadow, die by the shadow…",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Lives will be taken, and the real plan revealed.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Look at them, all broken and… dead.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Look at you. Flashing that utterly average mastery for everyone to see.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Look upon me, world! Look upon your saviour!",TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Look, Kayn! Gaze upon my works, and despair.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Looking for work? I could use someone with your talents!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Love the skin I'm in!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Love! Hope! Fear! I will feast it upon them all!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Make them pay for that!,TRUE,,,

Kayn,Malphite! What a loyal dog you are.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Mastery! The last twitch of a dying insect.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,May the violence never end!,TRUE,,,
Kayn,"Maybe, if you focus for once.",TRUE,,,
Kayn,Merely the first to die. There will be more.,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Mind if I cut in?,TRUE,,,
Kayn,Minions have spawned.,TRUE,,,

Rakan,It's tiny nerd and her pet Pix? How quaint. 'Quaint'. What a great word.,TRUE,,,
Rakan,I've been kicked around since I was born. It's alright! It's okay! I'm staying alive!,TRUE,,,

Rakan,Love is so cruel!,TRUE,,,
Rakan,Magic is a wilderness.,TRUE,,,

Xayah,Lost visual.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,Love conquers nothing and everything ends.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,Magic is again unfettered.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,Magic is not some river that can be easily channeled. It is a churning sea that goes where it pleases.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,"Make me look good, and I'll make you look good, got it?",TRUE,,,
Xayah,Make them remember!,TRUE,,,
Xayah,Maybe I overdid it.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,Me too.,TRUE,,,

Xayah,That one!,TRUE,,,
Xayah,That was a Vastayan farewell.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,That was for the Vastaya.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,"That was too easy, but so much fun.",TRUE,,,
Xayah,That's not an answer and you know it.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,That's not what—,TRUE,,,
Xayah,"That's right, babe.",TRUE,,,
Xayah,That's the idea.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,That's the opposite of a plan.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,"That's the problem with playing dumb. Sooner or later, it'll get you killed.",TRUE,,,
Xayah,Thatta girl.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,The best.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,The First Light failed us but I'm not bitter. I just wanna kill the Star Guardians and destroy everything.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,The heart is the biggest target.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,The next one to call me 'edgy' is getting choked to death.,TRUE,,,

Xayah,They don't always go wrong.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They dropped something. Their guard.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They make chaos dance.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They mindlessly marched right to their deaths. Like everyone in Noxus.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They mostly go wrong.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They say I don't know when to quit. Like that's a weakness.,TRUE,,,
Xayah,They should really get a refund from those masons.,TRUE,,,
